- Problem
    - s-t Path: Is there a path between vertices s and t?
    - Connectivity: Is the graph connected, i.e. is there a path between all vertices?
    - Biconnectivity: Is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph?
    - Shortest s-t Path: What is the shortest path between vertices s and t?
    - Cycle Detection: Does the graph contain any cycles?
    - Euler Tour: Is there a cycle that uses every edge exactly once?
    - Hamilton Tour: Is there a cycle that uses every vertex exactly once?
    - Planarity: Can you draw the graph on paper with no crossing edges?
    - Isomorphism: Are two graphs isomorphic (the same graph in disguise)?
